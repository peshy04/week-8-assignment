A CLINIC BOOKING SYSTEM

Here's how the database will be structured:
- Patients Table: Stores patient details with a unique patient ID.
- Doctors Table: Contains doctor details with specialization.
- Appointments Table: Links patients and doctors, recording appointment dates.
- Medical Records Table: Holds patient diagnosis and treatment history.
- Payments Table: Tracks billing and transactions.
Each table will use Primary Keys (PK) for unique identification, Foreign Keys (FK) to establish relationships, and NOT NULL/UNIQUE constraints where needed.
